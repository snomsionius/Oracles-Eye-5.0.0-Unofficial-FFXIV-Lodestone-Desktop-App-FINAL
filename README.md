# Oracle's-Eye-5.0.0-Unofficial-FFXIV-Lodestone-Desktop-App

NOW FASTER AND VIRUS FLAG FREE

Former Final-Fantasy-XIV-Lodestone-Desktop --Unofficial-  

## Short project summary:  
I was bored and thought : Lets create an app for the FFXIV Lodestone.  


#### Why?  
Because i felt like it and I had free time.    
Also, I didn't want to always open up the webbrowser and logging in. I wanted to have a program where I log in, it can be remembered and I can just start looking at the stuff I want.  

#### Roadmap  

Ver 1.0.2 -> Ver 2.0.0 -> Ver 3.0.2 -> Ver 3.5.8 (Scrapped in developement, too many new features) -> 4.0.0  -> Ver. 5.0 (Current)

#### About the Virus warning

## About the WIKI  

Although it is in its early stages, it can do quite a bit.At the time, I focused on making gear related items (sword,ring,armor....) working.  
These work as planned. Items like potions or ores are not fully supported right now, so you only get basic information from their page.  
Some items do NOT work at all right now, they will show you a pop-up and will offer to open the item in your browser.  
It is normal for the program to display "No Response" while searching. Do not worry.  

## About the Market board  

It can show every Item in the game with corresponding prices (lowest and median) BUT the prices are not real time.  
It is normal for the program to display "No Response" while searching. Do not worry.  

## Solved Bugs   
- Fixed some display Errors  
- Fixed bugs where functions would call wrong values and crash 
- Improved the sidebar 


## Features to come:  
 
-Stable Bozja insight.  
-In-App assistant/Guide.
